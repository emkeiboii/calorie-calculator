      <h3>what is BMI</h3>
      <p>The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.<br>
        <br>
        The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.
        </p>
      <h3>is bmi accurate?</h3>
        <p>BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.<br>
          <br>
          As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy weight.<br>
          <br>    
          Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.<br>
          <br>
          Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI of 23, which is usually considered healthy.
          <br>
          You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.
